# Frameworks and Libraries in Development

- **Efficiency through Reuse**
  - Development involves using existing solutions for faster building.
  - Frameworks & libraries contain established processes for development.

- **Frameworks vs. Libraries**
  - *Libraries*: Reusable code for specific functionalities.
    - E.g., email validation in an e-commerce site.
    - Saves time by using readily-available functionalities.

  - *Frameworks*: Provide structure for development.
    - Developer supplements framework with their code.
    - E.g., web app frameworks handle common functionalities like HTTP requests.

- **Framework-Library Relationship**
  - Frameworks utilize multiple libraries.
  - Applications can use both framework and additional libraries.

- **Choosing Between Frameworks and Libraries**
  - Frameworks are opinionated, enforcing structure.
  - Libraries offer more freedom in coding.
  - Advantages and disadvantages to both:
    - Frameworks: Efficient, pre-established practices, but may limit flexibility.
    - Libraries: Flexibility but require more decision-making and compatibility checks.

- **Development Considerations**
  - Frameworks enforce structure but might not fit all coding needs.
  - Libraries offer flexibility but need careful selection and compatibility checks.
  
- **Reuse for Efficiency**
  - Using frameworks & libraries results in faster development and fewer errors.
  - Allows developers to focus on essential features without reinventing functionalities.
