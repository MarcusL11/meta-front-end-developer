Arrays are objects
In JavaScript, arrays are objects. That means that arrays also have some built-in properties and methods.

One of the most commonly used built-in methods on arrays are the push() and the pop() methods.

To add new items to an array, I can use the push() method:

```js
var fruits = [];
fruits.push("apple"); // ['apple']
fruits.push('pear'); // ['apple', 'pear']
```

To remove the last item from an array, I can use the pop() method:  

```js
fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits); // ['apple']
```

Tying into some earlier lessons in this course, I can now build a function that takes all its arguments and pushes them into an array, like this: 

```js
function arrayBuilder(one, two, three) {
    var arr = [];
    arr.push(one);
    arr.push(two);
    arr.push(three);
    console.log(arr);
}
```

I can now call the arrayBuilder() function, for example, like this:  

```js
arrayBuilder('apple', 'pear', 'plum'); // ['apple', 'pear', 'plum']
```

Even better, I don't have to console log the newly built array. 

Instead, I can return it:

```js
function arrayBuilder(one, two, three) {
    var arr = [];
    arr.push(one);
    arr.push(two);
    arr.push(three);
    return arr;
}
```

Additionally, I can save this function call to a variable. 

I can name it anything, but this time I'll use the name: simpleArr.

```js
var simpleArr = arrayBuilder('apple', 'pear', 'plum');
```

And now I can console log the values stored in simpleArr:  

```js
console.log(simpleArr); // ['apple','pear','plum']
```
